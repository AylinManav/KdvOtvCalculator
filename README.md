# KDV and ÖTV Calculator

This project is a MATLAB application designed to calculate the total cost of a product using Turkey's **Value Added Tax (KDV)** and **Special Consumption Tax (ÖTV)** rates.

## Features
- Calculates KDV and ÖTV based on the entered product value.
- Provides cost analysis for normal and gradual taxation systems.
- User-friendly and interactive input system.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the product value.
2. The ÖTV rate is calculated based on the product value.
3. The total cost is determined by applying KDV on top of the ÖTV-included value.
4. A comparison is made between the normal and gradual systems.

## Usage
1. Install MATLAB or Octave on your computer.
2. Download the `KdvOtvCalculator.m` file.
3. Run the file in the MATLAB command window:
   ```matlab
   KdvOtvCalculator
4.	Enter the requested product value and review the calculated cost results.


Example
Input:
Please Enter Product Value: 100000
Output:
Total Amount with Normal System: ...
Total Amount with Gradual System: ...

Requirements
	•	MATLAB or Octave
